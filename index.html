        <p1>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.
          The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose
          Nylund (Wendy Bite) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the
          bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin),
          who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy"s mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),
          after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p1>

        <p2>Thank You for being a friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart is true, you"re a pal and a confidante.And
          if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached
          would say, Thank You For Being a Friend!</p2>
